User A : Prayagraj Nartam (PE5)
User B : Kshitish Deshpande (PE22)

## Key generation
- Run command `pgp -kg`
- Pick algorithm : go with `rsa`
- Pick rsa key size
- Enter userid (with email)
- Enter validity period (`0` for eternity)
- Enter passphrase
- Make default signing key if you want to

You can check the key generated by running `pgp -kv`

## Key extraction
Run `pgp -kxa emailid filename` to extract your public key into a file.
- `emailid` : email id of user whose key you want to extract
- `filename` : name/path of file to which the key will be extracted

You need to send this file to whoever you're gonna interact with so that they can encrypt their messages with your public key

# User B

## Key addition
To add an extracted key to your keyring, run `pgp -ka extracted_file`
- `extracted_file` : name/path of file which contains the extracted key you are trying to add to your keyring

To check if key has successfully been added, run `pgp -kv`

## Message Encryption
To encrypt a file using a certain key in your keyring, run `pgp -ea filename emailid`
- `filename` : name/path of the file to be encrypted
- `emailid` : email id of the user whose key you are using to encrypt the file

By giving the email id of whoever the file is meant to be sent to (user A in this case), you ensure that the message can only be decrypted by whoever has their secret key.

# User A

## Message Decryption
To decrypt a file, run `pgp filename`
- `filename` : name/path of the file to be decryptes

This uses secret key which is already present in your keyring to decrypt the file (generally a .asc file). If no secret key matches the encryption, pgp gives an error.
